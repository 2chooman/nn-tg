# NN Telegram App

A simple single page application rebuilt with **React**. All views are implemented as React components and routed via `HashRouter`.

## Running locally

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Parcel will serve the application and open it in your browser. When you are ready
to deploy a static build use:

```bash
npm run build
```

The contents of the `build/` directory can then be hosted with any static file
server.
